<h1>Irish Soda Bread Recipe</h1>

<p>Ella's <em>secret</em> Irish Soda Bread Recipe is a treasured Gorman family tradition. Passed down through generations, <em>the secret recipe has been given a life of its own</em>.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for currants</li>
<li>4 tablespoons sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2 inch dice</li>
<li>1 3/4 cups cold buttermilk, shaken</li>
<li>1 extra-large egg, lightly beaten</li>
<li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
<li>1 cup dried currants</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to <strong>375 degrees F</strong>. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>

<li>Combine the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.
  Add in the butter and mix on low speed until the butter is mixed into the flour.</li>

<li>With a fork, lightly beat the buttermilk, egg, and orange zest together in a measuring cup.
  With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture.
  Combine the currants with <em>1 tablespoon</em> of flour and mix into the dough. It will be very wet.</li>

<li>Dump the dough onto a well-floured board and knead it a few times into a round loaf.
  Place the loaf on the prepared sheet pan and lightly cut an X into the top of the bread with a serrated knife.
  Bake for <strong>45 to 55 minutes</strong>, or until a cake tester comes out clean.
  Be sure to hear a hollow sound when tapping the loaf.</li>

<li>Cool on a baking rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. <strong>And most of all, enjoy with friends and family!</strong></li>
